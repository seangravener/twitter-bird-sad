# Twitter Bird
For practice, I recreated a sad twitter bird from scratch in Photoshop CS6 following a tut on psd.tutsplus.com.

## Areas in Which I Improved:
- designing with simple shapes
- extensive use of layer effects, including unique uses of beveling and shadows
- blending layers
- advanced lighting techniques (inferior areas, inferior reflection, spherical volume)
